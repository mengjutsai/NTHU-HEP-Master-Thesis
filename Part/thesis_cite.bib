  Abstract                 = {We apply a simple dynamical density functional theory, the phase-field-crystal (PFC) model, to describe homogeneous and heterogeneous crystal nucleation in 2d monodisperse colloidal systems and crystal nucleation in highly compressed Fe liquid. External periodic potentials are used to approximate inert crystalline substrates in addressing heterogeneous nucleation. In agreement with experiments in 2d colloids, the PFC model predicts that in 2d supersaturated liquids, crystalline freezing starts with homogeneous crystal nucleation without the occurrence of the hexatic phase. At extreme supersaturations crystal nucleation happens after the appearance of an amorphous precursor phase both in 2d and 3d. We demonstrate that contrary to expectations based on the classical nucleation theory, corners are not necessarily favourable places for crystal nucleation. Finally, we show that adding external potential terms to the free energy, the PFC theory can be used to model colloid patterning experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {A technique has been developed for the determination of the absolute surface energies of iron and iron alloys at temperatures of up to the melting point. The technique is based upon the measurement of the contractile forces in thin foils. All measurements are made in situ and chemical equilibrium is maintained throughout the experiment. The results show that phosphorus in dilute solid solution decreases progressively the surface energy of iron at 1450 ?C from 2100 ergs cm-2 to 1200 ergs cm-2, for increasing phosphorus contents of up to 0.36%. Results were also obtained for the ? phase in which the effect is less pronounced. Absolute grain boundary energies were also determined as a function of phosphorus content. From the strain rate of the foils which move by a diffusion creep mechanism, it was deduced that the self diffusion coefficient increases linearly with phosphorus content. Application of the Gibbs adsorption theorem has permitted the evaluation of the extents of equilibrium segregation of the solute to interfaces. The maximum levels are 2.3 x 10-9 g-atom cm-2 at surfaces and 1.1 x 10-9 g-atom cm-2 at grain boundaries. The relevance of these measurements to the problem of the intergranular brittle fracture of iron/phosphorus alloys is discussed.},
